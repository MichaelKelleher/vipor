VIdeo POker Research

Vipor is a personal research simulator for video poker and bonus poker variants.

Goals:
- Fast Monte Carlo experimentation
- Explicit modeling of bonus mechanics (Hot Roll, Super Hot Roll, Ultimate X)
- Strategy comparison under realistic machine behavior
- Risk-of-ruin analysis for real bankroll decisions

This is not a commercial product.
This is not optimized prematurely.
This is for curiosity, clarity, and fun.

I would like to create a python based video poker simulator where I can put in pay tables and simulate different strategies and compute things like Risk of Ruin for a given stake, EV, etc.

Please outline (briefly) the steps we need such as:

A deck and deal simulation.
Hot Roll Simulation.
Pay Table input and management.
Strategy codification semantic (always keep pairs, keep three or more suited royals, etc.)
Run controls
I know this could be quite an effort, but I think it will be fun and help manage our gambling hobby.
